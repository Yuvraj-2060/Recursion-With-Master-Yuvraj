# Recursion
### Introduction
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. This approach breaks down a problem into smaller sub-problems of the same type. A recursive function typically has *** two main parts:***

## 1). Base Case: This stops the recursion when a certain condition is met.
## 2). Recursive Case: This continues the recursion by calling the function itself with modified parameters.

# Advantages of Recursion
## 1). Simplifies Code: Recursion can make code easier to read and write, especially for problems that have a natural recursive structure (like tree traversal).
## 2). Solves Complex Problems: Problems that can be broken down into similar sub-problems are often more easily solved with recursion.

# Disadvantages of Recursion
## 1). Performance: Recursive functions can be less efficient and may lead to stack overflow if the recursion is too deep.
## 2). Memory Consumption: Each recursive call uses stack space, which can lead to increased memory usage.
